                <p>The setting we have chosen is a hotly contested Los Angeles border zone between the Bloods and Crips territory. The Bloods and Crips are two major street gangs who operate across America through selling drugs, and on a more violent scale theft and murder. Both gangs were founded in Los Angeles so we thought it was a good, centralized location that would be the most comparable to the situation illustrated in Romeo and Juliet. The gangs have had a long-standing rivalry for decades and both being founded in Los Angeles makes the city a hotspot for gang violence. It would not make much sense for the setting to retain its location in England because both gangs are not present outside of America. This setting differs from the traditional Elizabethan setting by using a more modern one to emphasize the themes of division more heavily. This scene would also take place in a more run-down, poorer part of the city than in Romeo and Juliet when they were essentially fighting in the middle of a big city at the time. This is an important distinction to make because rather than royal families with huge amounts of wealth the Bloods and Crips are street gangs that traditionally recruit people from impoverished areas.</p>
