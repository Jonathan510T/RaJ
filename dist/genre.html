                <p>The reason we chose the genre of gangs and gang violence is because we felt it was a very easy transition to relate to our thesis statement and we personally enjoy the music it is inspired by. Our thesis statement emphasizes how promising your unreserved loyalty to a group of people can be detrimental by causing oneâ€™s rationality to be removed. We felt that the scene where Tybalt and Mercutio are both killed very directly address the issues, we were looking for with our thesis statement. We felt Romeo and Juliet already lent itself heavily into the core concept of two opposing sides brawling against each other for superiority and therefore resulting in negative consequences that are unable to be retracted. With this in mind rather than the two royal families of Montague and Capulet we simply changed them to a more modern setting with two street gangs, the Bloods and the Crips. We also both listen to hip hop music extensively and we thought the themes represented through this genre of music are very similar and could be greatly represented through the medium of Romeo and Juliet. Because many rappers today have been, or are currently affiliated with a gang we felt it was a natural connection that would be a fresh and exciting way to illustrate our theme perfectly</p>
