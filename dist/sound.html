                <p><strong>Shotta Flow 2 - NLE CHOPPA</strong></p>
            
                <p>The reasoning behind our decision to use Shotta Flow 2 is primarily based on the rhythm mood and general meaning behind the song and how it connects with the scene. In the scene we noticed that it is an extremely fast-paced and aggressive scene with lots of action, similarly in the song it has a very aggressive and rapid flow that generates excitement in the listener. Lyrically the song speaks very heavily on the gang/crime related activity that the rapper and his friends take part of. However, one thing that NLE CHOPPA speaks heavily on is how he is not afraid to face any violence and is ready to spark violent conflict with anybody just for their opposite ties. For example, in the song he speaks down on opposite gangs making them appear as soft and only talking for show. Then right after he claims that he will make them pay for their ignorance by killing them.  Similarly in the scene for Romeo and Juliet when Tybalt saw Romeo, he approached him with conflict and was clearly looking for a fight. Even though Romeo tried to disengage eventually Tybalt pressured him to hard and it ended in his death just due to their opposite ties.</p>

                <p><strong>21 - Polo G</strong></p>
                <p>The reason we chose 21 by Polo G is because we felt it perfectly tackles the subject of how gang violence can impact people and cause death and destruction through its profound lyrics and rich melody. The artist, Polo G was a gang member previously and the words in the song might be slightly embellished but are rooted in personal experience. They lyrics address Polo Gâ€™s younger days in Chicago where he grew up. He talks about how gang violence has shaped his life and how many people he knew have been killed as an effect of it. The lyrics are an exceptional background to our scene because as the people in the scene are processing the deaths of two people the beautiful words of 21 can help further cement this idea of how irrational division can have severe consequences on the people that take solace in it. The melody is light and not too overbearing and puts the focus on what he is saying rather than the instrumental. The beat has achieved an ideal balance between being not so fast as to where it becomes difficult for the listener to understand the lyrics but not too slow to become dull and lifeless.</p>
