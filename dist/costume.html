                <p>Our scene will be taking place in a modern low-income part of Los Angeles and focuses on the gang culture of the area. For example, sporting certain colors, wearing cheaper clothing, and carrying weapons due to violence in the area. In our genre the characters loyalty life and decisions are defined by their colors either red or blue, Blood or Crip like the rivalry in Romeo and Juliet. As well as this, in this era conflict is shaped by firearms as they are such a powerful necessity that everyone carried, like swords in the Elizabethan era. In the original play, the fight seems dragged and bland due to the lackluster use of swords. With the use of firearms, the scene becomes faster paced, creating an entertaining scene that doesnâ€™t cover the original ideas of the play. One of the main differences we emphasize is the difference in status of the characters. Our characters are low income and because of that their clothes are cheaper, and we use that to emphasize a greater theme about the dangers of affiliating with irrational groups like gangs. In Romeo and Juliet, they are born into their affiliation as that was the common life that many were placed in, in that era. However, in modern times many join these groups due to the extreme poverty that they are in and look to these groups as a way for them to socialize and better deal with their problems.</p>
